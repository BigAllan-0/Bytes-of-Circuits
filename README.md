# Bytes-of-Circuits
This repository is a collection of circuits designed primarily for fun and preservation. Some were created by myself while some were my attempt at recreating circuits found in classic electronic magazines or kits. These circuits are a great way to learn electronics for beginner hobbyists or intermediates to entertain themselves on a rainy day.
